## CSCI 200
For the Sunday submission of your design document, a "natural" division would be a section for each of the six managers (Part Manager, Kit Manager, Factory Production Manager, Kit Assembly Manager, Lane Manager, Gantry Robot Manager), a section for the server, and a section for your data model - all the Factory State. Your 201 teammates will have one, or more, sections for their agents.

Be sure that you have nice pictures of each of the screens for each manager. Describe the Swing components on each screen (except the labels) and connect them with the Factory State data model.

For the graphical panels, you are to have a drawing/schematic of what it is going to look like. Having exact coordinates for sizes and locations of things would be a good idea - make the programming easier starting on Monday.
