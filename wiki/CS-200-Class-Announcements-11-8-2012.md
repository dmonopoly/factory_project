+ On the week of 11/12/2012 (next week), teams will be presenting their `v1` progress during class time. Details are in the [CS 200 Team Progress Reports](CS-200-Team-Progress-Reports) wiki page

+ Since the TAs will be enjoying your presentations next week, they will not be coming to _next week's_ lab sessions. The labs will be available for you to use for team meetings, but the TAs will not be there. **Labs are running as usual this week**.

+ If your team is using doxygen or javadoc as a component of their _Design Document_, the team **must** have a representative come to my 4-6pm lab in SAL 126 today.

+ If your team (or part of your team) is still using non-wiki based design documents like google/word documents, the team **must** have a team representative come to my 4-6pm lab in SAL 126 today.

+ I periodically update [factory_project](https://github.com/usc-csci200-fall2012/factory_project) wiki. So make sure you visit the pages every once and a while:
   - https://github.com/usc-csci200-fall2012/factory_project/wiki
   - https://github.com/usc-csci200-fall2012/factory_project/wiki/Git-Resource

+ I am actively updating the [factory_project](https://github.com/usc-csci200-fall2012/factory_project) submission notes and answering questions on the issue tracker. Anything mentioned there I consider is as good as sending a class-wide email. Therefore, you may want to use the GitHub [watch feature](https://github.com/blog/1204-notifications-stars) to make sure you are up to date.

+ Doing something cool or interesting qualifies your team to get 0.25 points of extra credit toward the team score in the next deliverable. It is up to Rami to decide what is cool or not. Here are examples of how two teams got EC points:
    - https://github.com/usc-csci200-fall2012/factory_project/pull/2
    - https://github.com/usc-csci200-fall2012/factory_project/issues/6

+ HW3 AI Player - a number of students got deductions for not having AI Player extend Player. We agreed to revert that deduction. It is still bad design not to have done that. In order to get your points back, please come and see _any_ TA during lab time and they will fix it for you. No fixes via email.
