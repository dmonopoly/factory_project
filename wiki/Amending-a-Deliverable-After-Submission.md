Teams may discover after committing a deliverable that something may have been missed, included by error or is just wrong. The course policy is clear that no [late submissions](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci200/assignments_f2012.html) of the factory project deliverables are accepted.

The TAs (meaning Rami) **may** entertain requests for trivial amendments for things such as compile commands or missing attribution of a design section if and only if:

1. A new page on the team wiki created with the following details:
  * **Title**: "Team `XX` Amendment to `YY`", where `XX` is the team number and `YY` is the deliverable name
  * **Summary**: a one to two paragraph summary containing:
     + The amendment
     + Why it is needed
     + The reason this information was not included in the submission by the deadline
  * **Amendment**: this is the text of the amendment that the TAs/graders need to see.
1. An issue was raised in the team's issue tracker with:
  * **Title**: put in an appropriate title
  * **Label**: Bug
  * **Assigned to**: [@alghanmi](https://github.com/alghanmi)
  * **Milestone**: the grading milestone of that deliverable, e.g. "Grading - Factory Skeleton v. 0"
  * **Issue Text**: copy and paste the summary section in (1) and include a link to the wiki page.
1. It was raised within 24hrs of the deliverable's deadline

GitHub will alert the appropriate staff to the existence of this bug and the issue will be commented on within 48hrs of raising it. Please don't send an email unless 48hrs passed on creating the issue, otherwise the issue will not be entertained.
