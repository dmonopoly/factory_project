The week of Nov 12 will be **Factory v.1 Progress Report** week. Each teams will give a 15 minute in-class presentation highlighting their progress toward the `v.1` milestone. The presentation structure is _exactly_ as follows:

  + A single title slide with the following information
       - Team number
       - Team name (if different than above)
       - List of team members
       - Team manager name (if exists)
  + A Code Design Overview set of slides:
      - Slide Set A - GUI Design: showing two panels per slide
      - Slide Set B - Data Model: a two slide maximum.
  + A discussion of the following components from their GitHub Repository (live from website):
      - Issue tracker & milestone completion including both open and closed issues
      - Graphs: Contributors, Commits & Impact
  + Live Code Demo of what works

Teams will be picked at random. Therefore, each team must be ready to present at any time during their regularly scheduled class time.

After the presentation is done, the team is to:
+ Create a wiki page titled "Team XX Factory Project v1 Progress Report"
+ Use PowerPoint's [save presentation as pictures](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/save-a-slide-background-or-object-as-a-picture-HP005195155.aspx) feature to export the presentation as a set of images
+ Add those images to the wiki page.
