## Introduction
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds to be used for the Linux kernel development. It quickly grew to be one of the most widely used source code management systems.

In class, you have been introduced to [git](http://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/) and their use within the context of your project. This page will hold pointers to the introductory material and a listing of some git resources.

## Learning Git
As with almost all technologies, there are two main ways to learn things: a formal introduction (takes more time) or a quick tutorial to get you going fast. Depending on what you prefer, here are some good places to start:

### Formal Introduction to Git
1. If you are new to version control, or you want to get a lightweight overview before diving into the material, start with these set of short videos:
   + [What is Version Control?](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control)
   + [What is Git?](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git)
   + [Get Going with Git](http://git-scm.com/video/get-going)
   + [Quick Wins with Git](http://git-scm.com/video/quick-wins)



1. The [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) book is a concise discussion of git, how and why it works. The book is available freely online and licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).
    + For a basic intro to git, read chapters [1](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started) and [2](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics)
    + [Chapter 3](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching) discusses branching which is an important aspect about git, however, it is not fundamental when you are just getting started.

### Tutorials
1. [GitHub's Try Git](http://try.github.com) is an interactive introduction which is also part of [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)

1. [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)
