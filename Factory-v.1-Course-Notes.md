## FAQs:
**Q**: Should the (v1) factory project part manager let the user choose from a predefined list of part images, or let the user type in the filename of the image? Various group members had conflicting recollections about what you said about this, so I figured I ought to ask you.

**A**: You could do either. If you have a set list of file names, then displaying the image to the user, so they pick the image they want, would certainly be easier on the user than having to remember a file name.
What you do not have to do is allow the user to upload an image, or enter an arbitrary image file name that doesn't already exist. -- Prof. Crowley
